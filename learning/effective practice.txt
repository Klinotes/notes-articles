Tips for effective practice
According to Boesler and Greene, effective practice is consistent and focused and it targets the weaknesses that exist at the edge of our current ability. For effective practice, keep the following in mind.

Thankfully for us, our axons are naturally insulated by a fatty substance called myelin. Myelin serves the same purpose for our axons as insulation does for electrical wires.

Targeted practice
Practice should also be targeted, meaning that during each session you focus on a particular weakness that exists in your current performance. Don�t just practice for the sake of practicing.

Scientific theory
Exactly why practice improves performance for a long time remained unclear, but scientists do now have a theory. And it�s all to do with the nerve fibers in our brains.

R&R
In order for our bodies and brains to function at their optimum level, they need time to rest and recover. Try to split your practice time into shorter sessions and spread them throughout the day.

Practice makes perfect: how to practice any skill effectively
The saying "practice makes perfect" is one of the oldest in the book. No one is a stranger to the idea that repeating an action will help us improve our performance of that action.

But what is new to many people is the idea that there is right way to practice. Slogging away for hours on end is not necessarily the most effective method of improving a skill.

Little and often
It is also a good tactic to practice little and often. Of course, elite athletes and performers practice for hours each day, but normally those hours are not done on the trot.

Just like electrical wires, axons function most effectively when they are properly insulated: proper insulation limits energy loss as the signals travel, allowing information to get quickly from A to B.

In their Ted Ed video, Annie Boesler and Don Greene explain simply and clearly exactly how practice can improve the way in which our brains communicate with our muscles.

In practice
So there you have it: an explanation as to how practice makes perfect. But does that mean that slogging away at a skill for hours on end will necessarily help you achieve excellence?

In order for our muscles to contract and our bodies to move, information needs to travel from the gray matter in our brains to our muscle tissue via nerve fibers. Those nerve fibers are called axons.

Focus
To ensure that your practice is focused, rid your surroundings of distractions before starting a session. Take a look around you and identify anything that is likely to break your focus.

Focus
In one study of 260 students, in which the students were given a task to complete, researchers found that the students were able to stay focused on the task at hand for an average of just six minutes.



Effective practice
The short answer is no. Whether or not you will be successful depends not only on the number of hours you spend practicing; it is important to ensure that your practice is effective.

Common knowledge
It is no great secret that achieving excellence requires practice. From a young age most of us are taught that practice makes perfect and that repetition is key.

Building myelin
With our layers of myelin nice and thick, information can travel more efficiently from our brains to our muscles, and improved neural pathways mean improved performance.

Building myelin
Recent studies on mice suggest that myelin changes with practice. Every time we repeat an action, we build up the layers of myelin insulating our axons.


Laptops, smartphones, and in particular Facebook were the main culprits for distraction. So before starting your practice, turn off your television and set your cell phone to airplane mode.

Continuous integration
A software development practice where developers regularly merge their code changes into a central repository, after which automated builds and tests are run.

Continuous delivery
Code changes are automatically built, tested, and prepared for a release to production. Done properly, developers will always have a deployment-ready built artifact.

Continuous observability
Continuous observability of your system across all stages of DevOps allows you to manage the performance and availability of software applications. This leads to quick response times, improved computing processes and satisfied customers.

Continuous automation
In addition to CI/CD, bringing automated testing, monitoring and remediation to the DevOps lifecycle shortens innovation cycles, speeds up application delivery and reduces MTTR.

AI-driven DevOps
AI integrated into DevOps allows for quicker identification and resolution of issues through root cause analysis, improved collaboration between teams, and the ability to make risk-free release decisions.

Shift-left
Process of pushing testing (code quality, performance & security) toward the early stages of the SDLC. By testing early and testing often, you can find and remediated bugs earlier and improve the quality of software.

Shift-right / Progressive delivery
Process of monitoring, observing, and testing (resiliency, reliability and security) of new releases “in production” to ensure correct behavior, performance, and availability.

DevSecOps
DevSecOps expands the impact of DevOps by adding security practices to software development and delivery process. It resolves the tension between DevOps teams that want to release software quickly, and security teams that prioritize security over all else.

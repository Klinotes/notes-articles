## Observations

Things cost more than what you think.

Feel fear strongly. 
Do inspite of fear. 
Normal to fear fear.


ELON MUSK

Make people exciting about the future.

Life cannot be about solving one miserable problem after another.
There need to be things that inspire you that make you glad to be, 
to wake up in the morning and be part of humanity.

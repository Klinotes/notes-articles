Critically evaluated the effectiveness of the presentation and discussion for:
Organisation, structure and pace

quite well organised, in a logical order. presenter used slides which were clear and useful. at the end was an activity, asking viewers what they thought of body language of people on a slide.
the presentation had an introduction and a conclusion. the pace was ok but presenter had lots of pauses and um, er, and when speaking he spoke quite quickly.

Clarity, expression, language and achievement of intended purpose:
quite clear, a few repetitions and backtrack when he forgot something. Language was good, a few grammatical errors. Acheieved his purpose of explaining difference between the two different types of communication he was presenting.
Didn't speak at a steady pace, as noted in the last point. Used good short sentences and explained quite well. the powerpoint presentation with diagrams was good.
(Sorry Karoli i didn't notice metaphors or Rhetorical questions or Hyperbole etc).

Non-verbal communication methods:
I didn't notice as presenters picture was too small.

Audience engagement, questions and answers:
There was an activity, as I said earlier, which engaged the audience. There weren't really questions and answers apart from that. presenter listened to verbal information from other members. he indicated his understanding of what they said by replying and explaining. he responded well to questions asked.

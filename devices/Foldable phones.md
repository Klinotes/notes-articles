Google looks set to add minimum hardware standard requirements to its foldable Android licenses if rumors are to be believed.

According to Android expert Mishaal Rahman, Google will soon institute hardware and software requirements for foldable devices on Android. Manufacturers will need to complete a questionnaire and provide samples to ensure phones meet certain standards.

Rahman revealed the news to his Patreon following that the key requirements will be that phones must withstand at least 200,000 folds, equal to at least 5 years of use for most people. 

On top of this, Torque hinge devices need 80% of original torque after the folds, meaning that the force you need to unfold the device must not diminish more than 20 percent after those 200,000 folds and unfolds.

  4GB of RAM which is easily enough for most apps but it won’t make this tablet remarkable for multitasking but is boosted by Honor Turbo. This feature adds up to 3GB of storage and uses it as RAM putting the tablet up to 7GB.
  7250mAh cell providing around 12 hours of streaming and gaming

# VR Headset
- Apple Vision Pro 
powered by twin Micro OLED displays that give each lens 4K resolution and pixel density 64 times greater than the iPhone. This is despite the fact that each display is about the size of a postage stamp.

Future: Liquid display that can be fine-tuned based on the needs of the viewer.

In the patent, Apple describes a system of multiple chambers with flexible and/or rigid walls. Using a system of actuators, pumps and reservoirs, the liquid (possibly in part an oil-based mixture) would then be able to form and deform to make an optical lens, acting on electronic signals sent to the system of actuators, pumps and reservoirs.

Then when you press on the key, it actually moves — pushing the key downward on the z-axis. And when you depress the key, it gives off a little pulse of light. Given that the virtual keyboard will lack any sort of physical feedb

Aromatherapy Olfactory

aromatherapy can lead to huge benefits in older adults

growing cognitive loss issues. 

Slowness in thinking

Human brains reach their peak performance at around age 30 and then slowly begin to decline according to the University of California San Francisco’s Memory and Aging Center.

“These age-related declines most commonly include overall slowness in thinking and difficulties sustaining attention, multitasking, holding information in mind and word-finding,” the Memory and Aging Center’s website explains. 


structures in our brains start to undergo a series of changes that alter the most important areas governing our cognition.

Age-related changes
“Research indicates that age-related changes in brain structures such as decreased hippocampal, frontal, and temporal lobe volumes are a common aspect of aging that contributes to some of the thinking changes,” the Memory and Aging Center note


combat age-related memory and cognition problems and all you really have to do is introduce a few new fragrances into your life

Researchers have discovered that adding some smells to your life can increase your cognition and they did so using essential oils diffused while older adults were sleeping. 

humans retained their memories or improved cognition through overnight olfactory enrichment,

olfactory enrichment—essentially boosting the sense of smell to produce a certain behavior—was a powerful tool for improving memories in animals as well as cognition in humans


Two hours a day for six months
The group that received olfactory enrichment did so for two hours every night over a period of six months, and during that time their memories “skyrocketed” according to a press release from the University of California Irvine on the new research. 


memories skyrocket according to the researchers
those who received olfactory enrichment during the study enjoyed a 226% increase in their cognitive capacity

Imaging later revealed that the reason why the participants may have experienced a big boost in their cognition could have been due to the strengthening of an area of the brain called the left uncinate fasciculus

left uncinate fasciculus, portion of our brain connects to the medial temporal lobe, which is part of the prefrontal cortex, and controls things like our decision-making. It’s part of the brain that severely weakens with age. 

Seven smells used
It's also important to note that the researchers only used seven different smells in their study in essential oil form—these included rose, orange, eucalyptus, lemon, peppermint, rosemary, and lavender from The Essential Oils Company in Portland Oregon. 

Improvements in sleep
Interestingly, the olfactory enrichment group not only showed big improvements in their memory and cognitive abilities but also reported that they slept much deeper according to the study’s authors. So maybe it’s time to pick up your own essential oil diffuser.

# Magnesium
Magnesium threonate is a synthesized form of magnesium that is formed when magnesium is combined with threonic acid, a product of the metabolic breakdown of vitamin C1. It is a form of the essential mineral magnesium, which the body requires for various functions, including protein synthesis, glucose control, and nerve function1. Magnesium threonate can readily elevate magnesium levels in the brain and has the potential to improve cognitive function1. However, research is still in the early stages and mainly involves animal models. Some animal studies have found that magnesium threonate is more effective at increasing magnesium ions in the brain and improving cognitive function than magnesium sulfate1. Therefore, doctors may recommend magnesium L-threonate to normalize an individualâ€™s magnesium levels and for potential benefits to the brain.

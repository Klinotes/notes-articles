The first and only proprioceptive treadmillin the world


Is This 3D Motion Treadmill from Reax Run the Future of Fitness?
The problem with bashing out miles on a treadmill isn’t just the tedium of staring at a gym wall. Hamstering away on the belt changes your running biomechanics. So, even though it works your cardio engine, when it comes to technique, form, muscle usage, brain activity and good old fatigue, tread miles aren’t the same as running in the great outdoors.

The Reax Run is here to change that. The world’s first and only 3D motion treadmill, it tilts, leans and shifts on its axis to create continuous and unpredictable changes in the angle of the belt. The result is a more challenging run experience that mimics the experience of tapping out miles over uneven roads and trails.

The higher proprioceptive activation works your brain and body, unlocking a range of benefits including higher energy burn, improved balance and a tougher workout for your muscles. Oh, and the Reax is faster too, with a top speed of 15.5mph, compared to most motorised gym 'mills 10-12mph. Is this the future of bootcamp cardio? MH runs the numbers.

Studies show that running on uneven surfaces can increase your energy burn by 5%. It also activates more leg muscles than trotting on smooth terrain.

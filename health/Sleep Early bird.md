Whereas night owls get a second burst of energy in the later hours, early birds tend to lose energy as the day goes on without getting a natural energy boost to keep them going.

Con: less socializing
With their schedules focused more on the morning and early afternoon, early birds are more likely to skip going out for drinks after work or having a night out.

Con: it can get too loud for them
As early birds thrive in the mornings, they get more tired in the afternoon, and usually this is when it gets tough for them. As other people get more chatty in the afternoon, they might get grumpy.

Con: they always wake up the same time
If morning larks are used to waking up early at the same time during the week, expect it to happen on weekends as well. The internal clock already knows when to wake, and it doesn't matter how tired they might be.

Con: they can give off the wrong impression
By always being early, early birds may give people the wrong impression. Rather than seeing them as a punctual person, fellow workers may think they work too hard and that they can never switch off.

While there are no direct health issues with being a morning lark, sometimes waking up early is a symptom of some health issues. This may be the case if they donâ€™t really feel that energy surge in the morning and are always tired.

Con: possible sleep deprivation
This depends on the type of job they have. If their job means they stay up late, it might be doing them more harm than good, as they won't be getting enough sleep.


Con: lack of flexibility
As morning larks are usually up by sunrise, they tend to be on time for things. But when an inconvenience pops up, it can be hard for them to work around it without feeling pressured or stressed.


Recognizing your personal sleeping pattern
And if you're still not sure if you're really an early bird, then the easiest way to figure it out is by recognizing your personal sleeping pattern. Do so by putting away your alarm clock and experiment with when you naturally go to bed and wake up.

It might take several days for your body to settle into its natural pattern. But eventually you'll notice you go to bed and wake up at around the same time.

It's all about the sleep quality
Whether you thrive until the late hours of the night or on early mornings, it's all about the sleep quality you get. In the end, good sleep plays an essential role in physical and mental well-being.

Things can change
Also, your sleep pattern can change as you get older. As you enter middle age, you may find yourself becoming more of an early riser.

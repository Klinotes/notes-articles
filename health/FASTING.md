FASTING

Dirty fasting is a type of fasting that allows some calories, usually up to 100, during the fasting window. It differs from clean fasting, which restricts all foods and calorie-containing beverages. Some people do dirty fasting because they feel less deprived or more energized with some nutrition. Dirty fasting is also called modified fasting.

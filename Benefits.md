Notes on benefits of cold and cold shower

- follow principles, individualised
- cold is relative, build it up
- tempeture change is beneficial all year round

- confidence
- good for heart, cardio vascular system

- more you reject, more you need
- hard at the beginnig until you get used to
- mental workout, balance, mood
- push to unconfortable state
- every time you push, you get more confident to do it again
- your cells 
- cold was embrace everyday, expose to cold
- healthy kind of stress
- useful, learn about stress
- cold tolerance, tolerance of cold
- narrow experience of life
- doesn't need much time, starts with seconds

- cold shock, activates and takes a minute to get over
- full activation of parasympathetic nervous system, getting into calm state of mind
- 

## Cold threshold

- not a sport, can't compete
- some more cold tolerant
- some have more sensitive nervous system
- longer cold exposure has risks
- can get hypothermia, frost bites

## After-drop

- core tempeture decreases after going out the cold
- blood vessels dilute again
- blood cool down from the cold tissues
- tempeture receptors signal the brain that's it is colder


## Cold immersion

- cold showers
- icy plunge pools
- outdoor swimming

- most achievable
- ending shower with cold water, 30, 60, 90 seconds
- boosting immune system
- cells build itself stronger, robust
- exhaust the cells, increase risk of outcome
- tempature is stressful, not overdo
- do acutely, called micro stress, healthy stress
- heat is also a stressor
- we have 3-10 times more cold receptors on the sking
- activate stress system
- getting sleepy if core tempeture decreases
- not shivering as much over time

### Stronger Immune System

Our immune system is influenced by multiple factors and is highly complex. In isolation, the benefits of cold water immersion are hard to measure. But several studies now link cold exposure to immune boosting benefits such as increased production of ‘killer T cells’ and lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell key to immune function.

### Cardiovascular Strengthening

The cold triggers our metabolism, our internal furnace, by releasing free form fatty acids (FFAs) and glucose. It also protects against insulin resistance that can lead to diabetes and atherosclerosis by inhibiting glucose production. The collaborative effects of vasodilation and vasoconstriction work together to switch our metabolism to fat burning mode.

### Mental alertness and focus

Regular cold water immersion drives wakefulness, alertness, learning and attention, enhanced memory formation and retrieval. It also supports top-down regulation of pain. It also increases dopamine by 250%, a natural ‘feel-good’ hit.

### Supports weight management

The cold triggers our metabolism, our internal furnace, by releasing free form fatty acids (FFAs) and glucose. It also protects against insulin resistance that can lead to diabetes and atherosclerosis by inhibiting glucose production. The collaborative effects of vasodilation and vasoconstriction work together to switch our metabolism to fat burning mode.


## What happens in cold?

- coreceptors on the skin
- signal to brain to release norepinephrine, adrenalin
- adrenaline stressor activates brown fat cells, which takes sugar and fat to generate heat
- less white fat

## Origin of brown fat

- brown fat discovered in 1531 by scientists exploring the physiology of hibernating animals

- squarrels hibernating in two degrees


## Brown fat

- cold is prevention to increase brown fat
- tempature regulator
- healthy metabolism
- cold is the main drive to activate brown fat

- born with brown fat, to generate heat
- muscles are slow to generate heat
- gain more brown fat if you exposed to stresses as cold
- comfort will make more white fat and less brown fat

- white fat is yellowish colour
- brown fat is brown from mitochondria
- in the cells are energy fabrics called mitochondria, cold activates the efficiencies of these cells

- brown fat need to get activated just like muscles
- cold water is relative, colder than the skin
- 15 C or bellow is cold
- insulin sensitivity
- brown fat is closed to the central nervous system, located along the , supracurricular bones, largest depot we have

House Room DEcorate

 what materials, colors, and furniture to choose in order to make your sunroom look more chic and expensive

 Decorate in a tonal color scheme
The easiest way to give your sunroom a luxurious, expensive look is to mimic the warm neutral colors found in nature. The power of a neutral color palette to add luxury, and elegance to a room should not be underestimated. Decorating with neutrals, inspired by colors from the natural world, adds a gentle and soothing touch to interiors that can be layered with textures and tones to ebb and flow with the seasons. 

'I love the calmness and sense of luxury and sophistication that you create when you have a neutral palette in a room, especially if you wish to replicate the popular quiet luxury aesthetic', says interior designer Tamsin Johnson.' But this choice definitely doesnâ€™t have to mean boring: you can create an interesting and exciting space by layering different tones, such as off-whites and beige, then introducing a range of caramels and even accents of black.'

This space had one intention in the new design: relaxation. 'We designed this as an opulent place to converse during family gatherings without the interruption of a TV,' says interior designer Whittney Parkinson. 'This room already had the advantage of the eastern morning sun, we just provided the neutral layers, shapes, and textures for a tranquil Xanadu.'
